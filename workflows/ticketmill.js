// =============================================================================
// ticketmill — stack-agnostic batch issue processing engine.
//
// Ported from flyspacea's batch-issues.js (itself a workflow port of
// batch-orchestrator.sh + implement-issue-orchestrator.sh). The process
// machinery — contamination guards, settled-decision ledger, handoff notes,
// claims, circuit breakers, degrade windows, preflight healing — encodes
// multiple runs of retrospective learnings and is preserved intact. What
// changed is everything project-shaped: agents, test commands, doc
// conventions, and browser verification now come from the TARGET REPO via
// its .claude/ticketmill.json profile and its .claude/agents/ directory.
//
// USAGE
//   Workflow({ scriptPath: '<repo>/.claude/workflows/ticketmill.js',
//              args: { branch: 'dev', issues: [701, 702] } })
//   Workflow({ scriptPath: ..., args: { branch: 'dev', labels: ['frontend'],
//              no_assignee: true, limit: 10 } })
//   Safe preview (probe only, no changes):
//   Workflow({ scriptPath: ..., args: { branch: 'dev', issues: [701], dry_run: true } })
//
// PROFILE (.claude/ticketmill.json in the target repo — written by mill-init)
//   The profile is REQUIRED. A missing profile halts the run: the engine never
//   guesses a toolchain, because a wrong guess silently skips verification and
//   silently-skipped verification ships broken code (the original engine's v4
//   retro paid for that lesson; see TEST LOOP below).

//     }
//   }
//
// AGENT MODEL (single mechanism, on purpose)
//   Roles are filled by the target repo's own agents (.claude/agents/<name>.md),
//   referenced by name in profile.roles. A stage prompt instructs its subagent to
//   READ the agent file first and adopt the persona — the engine never passes
//   agentType, so behavior does not depend on what the session's agent registry
//   happened to load at startup (newly generated agents work immediately, and a
//   run behaves the same before and after a session restart). Roles left null or
//   pointing at a missing file fall back to a built-in role charter, loudly.
//
// BATCH BRANCH MODEL
//   args.branch (BASE) is only ever the target of ONE human-reviewed PR. At startup
//   the run creates TARGET = Batch_<start timestamp> from origin/BASE (timestamp via
//   a `date` probe — Date.now() is unavailable here). All worktrees branch from
//   TARGET, all diffs/reviews compare against TARGET, and per-issue PRs squash-merge
//   into TARGET. The run ends by opening a PR TARGET -> BASE with "Closes #N" for
//   every completed issue — NEVER auto-merged; issues stay open until a human merges
//   that PR (per-issue merges into a non-default branch don't fire "Closes #"). To
//   heal/resume a batch, re-run with args.batch_branch: 'Batch_<ts>'.
//
// CROSS-RUN ISSUE CLAIMS (multi-machine coordination)
//   At Select time — BEFORE the concurrency queue drains — the run claims every
//   selected issue: a claim label + a "## Ticketmill Claimed" comment carrying
//   batch branch, run tag, host, and a started epoch. A second run started
//   elsewhere claims at ITS Select phase, finds a fresh foreign claim (< 12h),
//   and skips the issue; a post-then-verify race check (earlier epoch wins)
//   settles simultaneous starts. Claims from the SAME batch branch are recognized
//   as our own (resume). One-way compatibility: fresh claims left by the older
//   batch-issues engine ("## Batch Processing Claimed" / batch-in-flight label)
//   are honored as foreign claims too. Releases: per-issue at merge and on halt
//   notes, plus a Report-phase sweep; a dead run's claims expire via the 12h
//   staleness window. Claims are advisory — a died claim agent fails open.
//
// BROWSER VERIFICATION (opt-in, serial)
//   Only when profile.browser is configured. UI-testable changes (diff touches
//   profile.browser.ui_globs) get a live-browser pass twice: after the test loop
//   ('implement') and after PR reviews approve ('pre-merge'). The browser MCP is
//   ONE shared instance, so all browser stages across concurrent pipelines run
//   through a chained mutex; probes and fix stages run outside the lock. Each
//   pass boots profile.browser.serve_command (with {port} substituted per issue).
//   Two-layer locking: the JS mutex only orders stages THIS SCRIPT schedules, so
//   a host-global mkdir lock (/tmp/ticketmill-browser-lock, owner file, 30-min
//   stale-steal) additionally guards the browser itself; ad-hoc agent use goes
//   through the same lock.
//
// RESTARTABLE (two independent paths)
//   1. Same session, exact resume: Workflow({ scriptPath, resumeFromRunId: 'wf_...' })
//   2. Any session: re-run with the SAME args (+ batch_branch). The Select-phase
//      preflight reads GitHub/git state and routes each issue: merged/closed ->
//      skip; open PR -> review+merge only; partial branch/worktree -> implement
//      continues (setup is idempotent; every implement prompt checks existing
//      commits first).
//
// SELF-HEALING
//   - Every stage retries once with an attempt-stamped prompt (distinct journal key).
//   - Schema-forced structured output (the harness retries schema mismatches).
//   - Quality-loop stage errors degrade the task and continue (halt only when >= 3
//     of the last 5 tasks degraded).
//   - Test-loop stage errors halt the issue loudly (silent degradation would ship
//     broken code when CI does not run the suite).
//   - Circuit breakers: >= 3 issues failed, or >= 3 consecutive agent deaths
//     (the usage-limit signature) -> stop launching, report a resume plan.
//   - Failures post an issue comment with the halt stage + resume instructions.
//
// CROSS-PIPELINE CONTAMINATION GUARDS
//   - Scope guard: every stage prompt pins gh comment/edit targets to its own issue
//     and requires an "<!-- ticketmill <repo>#<issue> -->" marker on every comment.
//   - Contrarian gates mechanically delete trail comments whose marker names a
//     different issue (misfiled by a concurrent pipeline).
//   - Decision-chain records are issue-stamped; decisionChain() drops mis-stamped
//     records. sanitizeTasks() drops stub task descriptions (< 12 chars) so a
//     placeholder plan fails and retries instead of dispatching an empty task.
//
// LOOP-STEP VISIBILITY: every review/fix loop iteration posts its own issue/PR
// comment — the trail shows each round, not just "Task N Implemented".
//
// CONTEXT THREADING (how earlier agents inform later ones, 3-4 stages downstream)
//   - Decision chain: distilled per-stage summaries injected into judgment stages.
//   - Settled ledger: decisions adjudicated at contrarian gates travel forward with
//     a "re-open only with new evidence" contract.
//   - Handoff notes: work stages return notes_for_downstream (env quirks, anchoring
//     gotchas); a bounded ledger is injected into later implement/fix/test prompts.
//   - Learnings digest: one Select-phase agent distills process-retrospective.md
//     once; category sections are injected per stage.
//   - Issue trail: contrarian gates read the full GitHub comment trail — the
//     uncompressed record — before challenging.
//
// MODEL POLICY (override per stage via profile.models)
//   haiku/low  : mechanical gh/git probes, setup script, running the test suite,
//                batch-branch creation, UI-file probes

// CONSOLIDATION (unit-of-work) FOUNDATIONS
//
// A "unit" is either a singleton (today's per-issue path, verbatim) or a group
// (a primary issue + members[] processed as one worktree/branch/research/plan/PR).
// With zero groups every unit is a singleton, so a no-overlap run behaves
// byte-for-byte like today — that's the acceptance bar this whole abstraction is
// built to preserve.
//
// Judgment (the opus gate + capped contrarian challenge that PROPOSES groups) is not
// implemented here — this section only holds the pure, harness-testable plumbing it
// will be built on: the schema above, the comment markers that let a resumed run
// recognize a prior consolidation, and the reducers that turn "what the markers say"
// plus "what's live right now" into the units runPool() actually processes.
//
// STABLE GROUP ID: a group's PHYSICAL identity (worktree issue-N, branch issue-N-*,
// PR head — see scripts/setup-worktree.sh and the process_pr path) is bound to a
// group id that is chosen once and never changes. The group's LOGICAL primary (the
// issue carrying the comment trail) can move on re-anchor (e.g. the original primary
// got skip-flipped by a resume), but the group id does not — mixing the two up is
// exactly the contradiction the approach-gate contrarian caught. By convention the
// group id is the lowest issue number that has EVER been a member (see
// stableGroupId()); it is also the key healGroups()/reconcileGroups() index by.
// =============================================================================

// Comment titles (first line) that gate consolidation markers apart from ordinary
// trail comments. Every marker comment still ends with the canonical scope-guard
// line "<!-- ticketmill <repo>#<issue> -->" (see scopeGuard()) — these titles add a

//     normalized predicted_files path between two units, or — only when no path
//     is shared — a shared basename (weaker, e.g. same filename in different
//     directories).
//
// Cohesion-aware collapse guard (NOT size-keyed — a lane's fate never depends on
// how many units or edges it has, only on overlap structure): every heuristic
// edge is graded by what the SPECIFIC PAIR it connects directly co-predicts —
// STRONG (that pair alone shares >=2 distinct paths/basenames — e.g. an
// implementation file plus its test) is self-sufficient and always survives.
// WEAK (that pair shares exactly one) only survives as part of a WEAK-EDGE-ONLY
// chain whose edges collectively touch >=2 DISTINCT keys, counted strictly from
// the weak edges' own shared keys — never inherited from a neighboring strong
// cluster's unrelated paths. That scoping is what stops a single popular path
// (a magnet) from dragging a unit that touches only it into a lane that is
// cohesive for entirely unrelated reasons: a unit sharing only a magnet path
// with one member of a genuine 2-path cluster must not serialize with the whole
// cluster just because that cluster happens to pass the >=2 bar on its own.
// A weak chain that never reaches 2 distinct keys is a single-path promiscuous
// connector — the shape a magnet file produces (many otherwise unrelated units
// all touching one popular path) — and dissolves back to trusted-only, i.e.
// those units race instead of serializing. Trusted edges are never touched by
// this guard.
//
// DF (document-frequency) signal: advisory/metric-only, logged when a predicted
// path is matched by more than half the batch (min 3 units) — surfaced for human
// visibility but NEVER used to drop an intersection key or suppress an edge; that
// job belongs solely to the collapse guard above. serialize_globs paths are never

// ENGINE-OWNED GATE (issue #3, regimes b/c) — the deterministic post-implement
// backstop. scopeGuard()'s engine-owned clause (above) is advisory layer 1; this
// is layer 2. Modeled on runBrowserCheck immediately above: a READ-ONLY probe
// runs `git diff --name-only` against the batch baseline and returns every
// changed file; JS (never the agent) filters that list via matchesGlobs against
// ENGINE_OWNED, then routes on ctx.engineOwnedIntentional — computed once at
// Select from THIS issue's own prose (engineOwnedHit) and OR-folded across a
// consolidation group's live members (deriveUnits) — per the three-regime model
// documented above ENGINE_OWNED_GLOBS:
//   (b) intentional: this issue's own prose plainly targets the engine-owned
//       set, so an engine-owned diff is expected, deliberate work (e.g. issue
//       #3 itself). Leave the implementation exactly as committed — no revert.
//   (c) NOT intentional, but engine-owned paths showed up in the diff anyway:
//       the incidental/paraphrased silent-restore vector nonconvexlabs-com #77
//       actually was. A single-purpose stage hard-reverts ONLY the paths where
//       isHardRevertPath(f, ENGINE_OWNED, LOCKSTEP_INSTALLED_PATHS) is true —
//       lockstep-installed paths (e.g. this repo's own
//       .claude/workflows/ticketmill.js) are deliberately exempted so a
//       source-of-truth edit's installed lockstep copy is never clobbered by
//       this gate; any resulting divergence is left for the test loop's own
//       lint-engine byte-compare to catch in-band — see isHardRevertPath's doc
//       comment — to the batch baseline (origin/TARGET), commits, and pushes.
// Placed BEFORE runTestLoop() in implementIssue() (not near runBrowserCheck,
// which runs AFTER the test loop) so a revert this gate makes is re-validated
// by the SAME run's test suite / lint-engine byte-compare, in-band, rather
// than landing unverified.
// Never halts the run on its own: a dead probe or a failed/dead revert stage
// degrades to a recorded deferred follow-up (mirrors the anti-pattern rule —
// a skipped verification must be recorded, never silently swallowed) so a
// plumbing hiccup in this gate never blocks an otherwise-green issue.

// =============================================================================
// PROPOSECONSOLIDATION (Select-phase judgment gate; ABOVE the harness split like
// implementIssue/reviewAndMerge, so tests/harness.js can drive it with a scripted
// agent()). Takes EVERY live preflight, any resume_point — not just 'implement' —
// because the HEAL phase below must recognize a group whose members have since
// flipped to 'process_pr' (the shared PR already exists; a prior run crashed
// after creating it) or 'skip' (one member resolved independently); filtering the
// candidate set to 'implement' up front would hide those markers from healGroups()
// entirely. Only the PROPOSE phase (brand-new opus-gate groupings) is restricted
// to 'implement' candidates — see its own filter below. Proposes grouping
// candidate issues into ONE worktree/branch/research/plan/PR unit when — and only
// when — they share the same subsystem AND acceptance surface, or one explicitly
// depends on another. Grouping is the EXCEPTION: the conservative-bar prompt below
// treats "shared files touched" as a hint, never a reason, and an empty run
// (0 or 1 candidates) short-circuits for free with no agent call at all.
//
// TWO-PHASE, LIKE THE APPROACH/PLAN GATES IN implementIssue() — WITH ONE
// DELIBERATE ASYMMETRY:
//   1. HEAL: fold in any group a PRIOR run already proposed and recorded via
//      comment markers (buildConsolidationGroupComment/buildConsolidatedMemberComment,
//      see the CONSOLIDATION FOUNDATIONS block above) — a resumed run recognizes an
//      existing decision instead of re-litigating it. This runs even when
//      PROFILE.consolidation === false: turning the gate off mid-run must not
//      un-heal a group a PRIOR run already committed to.
//   2. PROPOSE + CHALLENGE: only the residual, unmarked candidates go in front of
//      the opus gate; each proposed group then runs a CAPPED contrarian challenge
//      (reusing CHALLENGE_SCHEMA and the 'contrarian' role, exactly like the
//      approach/plan gates). THE ASYMMETRY: where those gates proceed-with-caveats
//      at the cap, a contested consolidation group instead DISSOLVES back into
//      independent issues. Grouping entangles multiple issues' worktree/branch/PR
//      into one unit — an unresolved "maybe these shouldn't be one unit" is not a
//      caveat implementation can absorb the way "maybe this approach has a risk"
//      is, and the safe fallback (process each issue independently) is always
//      available — so the gate takes it instead of forcing a doubtful merge
//      through. The same reasoning is why a DEAD challenger also dissolves rather
//      than proceeding unchallenged (implementIssue's gates fail open there
//      because the issue MUST be implemented regardless; this gate is a pure
//      optimization it is always safe to skip).
//
// DRY_RUN: the marker heal and the opus PROPOSAL are read-only (gh issue view /
// --json reads only — no writes) and run exactly the same under DRY_RUN as for
// real. The CONTRARIAN CHALLENGE is skipped ENTIRELY under DRY_RUN (it posts
// trail comments) — a dry run previews the raw, PRE-CHALLENGE proposal instead
// (each such entry carries dry_run_preview: true so a caller never mistakes an
// unchallenged preview group for a finalized one).
//
// MARKERS: posting the group/member consolidation-marker comments themselves is
// deliberately NOT this function's job. Real membership is only settled after
// claims (a member can be excluded by reconcileGroups() if its claim races or its
// resume_point flips) — see reconcileGroups()/deriveUnits() above. Posting markers
// here, before claims, could stamp a marker naming a member that never actually
// joins the live unit; the post-claim materialization step (Select-phase wiring)
// owns marker posting instead.
//
// RETURN: Map<groupId, {groupId, primary, members: [issueNumbers], subsystem,
// rationale, dry_run_preview?}> — the SAME shape healGroups()/reconcileGroups()
// return, so a caller can hand it straight to reconcileGroups(map, livePreflights)
// after claims. Only ACCEPTED groups (healed, or opus-proposed + contrarian-
// accepted) appear; dissolved/never-grouped candidates are simply absent — callers
// fall them through to deriveUnits()'s ordinary singleton path, exactly like an
// issue that was never a consolidation candidate at all.
// =============================================================================

// computeLanes() shape, [{unitIndices:[idx,...], ...}], omitted, or empty — groups
// `items` INDICES into sets that must run serially instead of racing. min(limit,
// lanes.length) workers each steal ONE WHOLE LANE at a time (a shared `nextLane`
// counter — the same "grab whatever's next" contract the old flat pool had over
// `items` directly) and drain every unit in that lane ONE AT A TIME, in
// depends_on order (laneDrainOrder() below), before stealing another lane.
//
// No lanes arg — or every lane a singleton, which is exactly what computeLanes()
// returns when nothing overlaps — degenerates BYTE-FOR-BYTE to the pre-lane pool:
// each lane is one item, so "steal a lane, drain it serially" IS "grab the next
// item", in the same original order, with workers = min(limit, items.length).
//
// results stays length === items.length, keyed by ORIGINAL item index regardless
// of lane membership or drain order — every caller downstream (counts, batch PR
// body, run report) already assumes that flat, index-stable shape.
//
// STOP is checked before EVERY unit, not once per lane: once tripped, every
// remaining unit in the lane a worker is currently draining gets a not_started
// result without calling fn — and so does every unit in every lane no worker has
// stolen yet, because a worker that finishes (or STOP-sweeps) its current lane
// immediately steals the next one and STOP-sweeps that too. Exactly one
// not_started per remaining unit, same shape the old flat pool produced per
// remaining item.
//
// A throw from fn() is caught PER UNIT inside drainUnit(), never left to bubble
// into Promise.all: it becomes a `failed` result for that one unit and the worker
// moves on (next unit in the lane, then next lane) exactly like a stage()-level
// failure would. So Promise.all over the worker promises never rejects because of
// unit-level work — a throw partway through one lane can never tear down another
// lane's in-flight or already-written results, and results.length always stays
